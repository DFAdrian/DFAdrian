Some of my Proyects:

● Basic Budget App

 -Technologies used:
  HTML: For creating the structure and layout of the app
  CSS: For styling the app and making it visually appealing
  JavaScript: For handling user input, updating the UI, and performing calculations
  DOM (Document Object Model): For manipulating the HTML elements and updating the UI dynamically
  Web Storage (localStorage): For storing expense data locally in the browser for persistent access
  
 -Description: 
    This web app allows users to track their expenses and manage their budget. It provides a simple user interface where users can enter their expenses and amounts,       which are then displayed in a list. The total expenses and remaining budget are calculated and updated in real-time. The app also utilizes Web Storage to store         expense data locally, allowing users to access their expenses even after refreshing or closing the browser.
